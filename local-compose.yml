# Service definition for Consul cluster with a minimum of 3 nodes.
# For local development we use Compose v2 so that we have an automatically
# created user-defined network and internal DNS for the name "consul".
# Nodes will use Docker DNS for the service (passed in via the CONSUL
# env var) to find each other and bootstrap the cluster.
